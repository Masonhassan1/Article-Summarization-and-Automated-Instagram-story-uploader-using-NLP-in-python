This project is Made by Muhammd Zaheer.
This project automatically summarizes articles using NLP and creates images for instagram stories. It will also automatically upload these to instagram.

The whole process is automatic. What I mean by automating the whole process is that you just have to provide the URL of the article to my script and it will automatically, downlaod,parse and summarize the article , extract relevant image, resize the images to instagram aspect ratio, overlay summary on images and upload these images to instagram story as well.

It is an NLP releated project so go ahead and install nltk (NLP toolkit).
>>>import nltk
>>>nltk.download("punkt")


Then go ahead and install the required libraries by typing:
└─# pip install -r requirements

And you are ready to go.
